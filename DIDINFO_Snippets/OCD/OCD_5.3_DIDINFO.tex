\DIDINFO{OCD-5.3 :: This section shall provide a description of the new system.
Note that this is basically a summary of the detailed of \SPS and/or \SSS items. 
The description starts by identifying differences associated with different states or modes of operation (for example, regular, maintenance, training, degraded, emergency, alternative-site, wartime, peacetime). 
The distinction between states and modes is arbitrary. 
A system may be described in terms of states only, modes only, states within modes, modes within states, or any other scheme that is useful. 
If the system operates without states or modes, this paragraph shall so state, without the need to create artificial distinctions. 
The description shall include, as applicable:
\begin{itemize}[itemindent=5pt,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt, parsep=0pt]
\item The operational environment and its characteristics (3.2),
\item Interfaces to external systems or procedures (3.2)
\item Charts and accompanying descriptions depicting inputs, outputs, data flow, and manual
and automated processes sufficient to understand the current system or situation from the
userâ€™s point of view (3.2),
\item Capabilities/functions of the current system (3.3),
\item Performance characteristics, such as speed, throughput, volume, and frequency (3.3),
\item Major system components and the interconnections among these components (3.4 and 3.5),
\item Quality attributes, such as reliability, maintainability, availability, flexibility, portability,
usability, or efficiency, (3.11) and
\item Provisions for safety, security, privacy, (3.7, 3.8) and continuity of operations in emergencies (3.11).
\end{itemize}
