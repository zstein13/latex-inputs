\DIDINFO{SSDD-4.0.0 :: This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to describe the system architectural design. 
If part or all of the design depends upon system states or modes, this dependency shall be indicated. If design information falls into more than one paragraph, it may be presented once and referenced from the other paragraphs. 
Design conventions needed to understand the design shall be presented or referenced.
Note: For brevity, this section is written in terms of organizing a system directly into Hardware Configuration Items (HWCIs), Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs), and manual operations, but should be interpreted to cover organizing a system into subsystems, organizing a subsystem into HWCIs, CSCIs, and manual operations, or other variations as appropriate.}
