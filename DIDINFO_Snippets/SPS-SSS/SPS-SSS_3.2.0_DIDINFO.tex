\DIDINFO{SPS/SSS-3.2.0 :: This section lists the external interfaces to the system.
This section can be organized simply as inputs and outputs or in another logical grouping.
The goal is to introduce ALL of the external interfaces so that their data can be defined before the data is used in the processing section.
This section is divided as needed to specify the requirements, if any, for the system's external interfaces. 
This section may reference one or more Interface Requirements Specification (IRS) or other documents containing these requirements.}
