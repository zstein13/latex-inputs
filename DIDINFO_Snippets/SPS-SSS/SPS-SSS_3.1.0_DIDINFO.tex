\DIDINFO{SPS/SSS-3.1.0 :: If the system is required to operate in more than one state or mode having requirements distinct from other states or modes, this section shall identify and define each state and mode. 
Examples of states and modes include: idle, ready, active, post use analysis, training, degraded, emergency, backup, wartime, peacetime. 
The distinction between states and modes is arbitrary. 
A system may be described in terms of states only, modes only, states within modes, modes within states, or any other scheme that is useful.
If no states or modes are required, this paragraph shall so state, without the need to create artificial distinctions. 
If states and/or modes are required, each requirement or group of requirements in this specification shall be correlated to the states and modes. 
The correlation may be indicated by a table or other method in this paragraph, in an appendix referenced from this paragraph, or by annotation of the requirements in the paragraphs where they appear.}
