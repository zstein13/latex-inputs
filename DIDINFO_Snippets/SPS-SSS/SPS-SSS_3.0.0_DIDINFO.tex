\DIDINFO{SPS/SSS-3.0.0 :: This chapter shall be divided into the following sections to specify the system requirements, that is, those characteristics of the system that are conditions for its acceptance.
Each requirement shall be assigned a project-unique identifier to support testing and traceability and shall be stated in such a way that an objective test can be defined for it.
Each requirement shall be annotated with associated qualification method(s) (see section 4) and, for subsystems, traceability to system requirements (see section 5.a), if not provided in those sections. 
The degree of detail to be provided shall be guided by the following rule: Include those characteristics of the system that are conditions for system acceptance; defer to design descriptions those characteristics that the acquirer is willing to leave up to the developer. 
If there are no requirements in a given paragraph, the paragraph shall so state.  
If a given requirement fits into more than one paragraph, it may be stated once and referenced from the other paragraphs.}
