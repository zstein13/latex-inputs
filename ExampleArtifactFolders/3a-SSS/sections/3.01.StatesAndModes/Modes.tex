
A summary of the modes is provided in Table~\ref{tab:Modes}.
This table also provides a list of the states in which each mode is valid.
See the formal specifications, if applicable, in the following sections for formal statement of the mode requirements, and accompanying notes that provide further clarification on the meanings of the states.
