The \ThisSystem will be able to measure moisture levels and control irrigation in raised garden beds. 
\ThisSys is being developed by Zachary Steinberg and sponsored by University of Maryland Graduate Engineering. 
The operator and maintaner of \ThisSys will also be Zachary Steinberg. The \ThisSys will be operated outside along raised garden beds. 
\ThisSys is designed to be used by home gardeners. It is not intended for industry. \ThisSys will be controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller board.

Figure~\ref{fig:SystemOverview} shows the development kit used for the \ThisSys system.
