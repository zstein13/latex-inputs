\subsection{\StsTestCaseID}
\label{loc:Test\StsTestCaseID}
% \input{DIDINFO_Snippets/STS/STS_4.x.y.0_DIDINFO.tex}

Test \StsTestSpecID{Environmental Threshold Test} case \StsTestCaseID{Soil Moisture Threshold} will verify and validate that the Garden Control System successfully 
activates the GCS irrigation system during active watering mode when the temperature threshold is met.

\subsubsection{Requirements Addressed}
\label{loc:TestCaseRequirementsAddressed\StsTestSpecID\StsTestCaseID}
% \input{DIDINFO_Snippets/STS/STS_4.x.y.1_DIDINFO.tex}

This requirements validated by test \StsTestSpecID{Environmental Threshold Test} case \StsTestCaseID{Soil Moisture Threshold} are listed in \S~\ref{loc:TestCaseProcedure\StsTestSpecID\StsTestCaseID}.

\subsubsection{Prerequisite Conditions}
\label{loc:TestCasePrerequisiteConditions\StsTestSpecID\StsTestCaseID}
% \input{DIDINFO_Snippets/STS/STS_4.x.y.2_DIDINFO.tex}

This prerequisite condition for test \StsTestSpecID{Environmental Threshold Test} case \StsTestCaseID{Soil Moisture Threshold} is a functional temperature sensor and working firmware for \ThisSys.

\subsubsection{Inputs}
\label{loc:TestCaseInputs\StsTestSpecID\StsTestCaseID}
% \input{DIDINFO_Snippets/STS/STS_4.x.y.3_DIDINFO.tex}

This inputs for test \StsTestSpecID{Environmental Threshold Test} case \StsTestCaseID{Soil Moisture Threshold} are listed in \S~\ref{loc:TestCaseProcedure\StsTestSpecID\StsTestCaseID}.

\subsubsection{Expected Outputs}
\label{loc:TestCaseExpectedOutputs\StsTestSpecID\StsTestCaseID}
% \input{DIDINFO_Snippets/STS/STS_4.x.y.4_DIDINFO.tex}

This expected outputs for test \StsTestSpecID{Environmental Threshold Test} case \StsTestCaseID{Soil Moisture Threshold} are listed in \S~\ref{loc:TestCaseProcedure\StsTestSpecID\StsTestCaseID}.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Criteria}
\label{loc:TestCaseEvaluationCriteria\StsTestSpecID\StsTestCaseID}
% \input{DIDINFO_Snippets/STS/STS_4.x.y.5_DIDINFO.tex}

This evaluation criteria for test \StsTestSpecID{Environmental Threshold Test} case \StsTestCaseID{Soil Moisture Threshold} are listed in \S~\ref{loc:TestCaseProcedure\StsTestSpecID\StsTestCaseID}.

\subsubsection{Assumptions and Constraints}
\label{loc:TestCaseAssumptions\StsTestSpecID\StsTestCaseID}
% \input{DIDINFO_Snippets/STS/STS_4.x.y.6_DIDINFO.tex}

This assumptions and constraints for test \StsTestSpecID{Environmental Threshold Test} case \StsTestCaseID{Soil Moisture Threshold} are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A facility where temperature can be controlled and varied
    \item Access to a water supply
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Procedure}
\label{loc:TestCaseProcedure\StsTestSpecID\StsTestCaseID}
% \input{DIDINFO_Snippets/STS/STS_4.x.y.7_DIDINFO.tex}

This procedure for test \StsTestSpecID{Environmental Threshold Test} case \StsTestCaseID{Soil Moisture Threshold} is to vary the soil moisture and verify that the soil moisture sensor is measuring accurate moisture levels.
When the measured soil moisture level rises above 650, the irrigation system will activate until the soil moisture level drops below 450.

See step~\ref{loc:Step2} for how to reference specific steps.
