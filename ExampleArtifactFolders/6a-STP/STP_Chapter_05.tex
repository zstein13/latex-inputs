\chapter{Schedule}
\label{loc:Schedule}

This section provides an overview of the testing schedule.

{\em When the \STP is developed, a general time line should be established so general dates should be understood, but exact dates may not be known.
Thus, this schedule sets expectations for need-by dates for resources such as laboratories, test ranges, etc.}
