This section provides the overall technology resource requirements for the system. 
These capabilities are divided into the following sections:
\begin{description}
	\item[Hardware] details about the hardware to be used. 
	\item[Software] details about the software to be used.
	\item[Communications] details about the communications to be used.
	\item[Other] details about other technology resource requirements not covered above.
	\item[Utilization] details about the resource utilization.
\end{description}
