A summary of the sub-states is provided in Table~\ref{tab:SubStates}.
This table also provides a list of the states in which each sub-state is valid.
See the formal specifications, if applicable, in the following sections for formal statement of the sub-state requirements, and accompanying notes that provide further clarification on the meanings of the states.
