
A summary of the sub-modes is provided in Table~\ref{tab:Sub-Modes}.
This table also provides a list of the mode in which each sub-mode is valid.
See the formal specifications, if applicable, in the following sections for formal statement of the sub-mode requirements, and accompanying notes that provide further clarification on the meanings of the states.
