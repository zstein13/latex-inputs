\ONERQMTVKPP
% #1 is requirement Number
{\RqtNumberBase.1}
% #2 is Title
{Power}
% #3 is requirement label (expected to be of form rqt:XXX)
{rqt:Operator Inputs}
% #4 is Text of the specification
{All \ThisSys variants shall be capable of \TBD operator inputs.}
% #5 is Status (S in {(T), (O), (I), (D)} listed by phase as \item [] S)
{
	\item [Phase 1] Threshold
}
% #6 is Acceptance
{This requirement shall be verified by demonstration.}
% #7 is Traceability
{
	\item [N/A] This requirement is a base requirement.
}
% #8 is Notes; listed as enumeration \item ...
{
  \item Add as many of these as necessary. Split into files, e.g., OperatorInputs.tex and OperatorOutputs.tex, as needed. Just use the RequirementNumberAM and RqtNumberBase commands to keep numbers correct if subsubsections are added.
