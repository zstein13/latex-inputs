\input{SSS_Section_3.0_Intro}% from LATEX Inputs folders

Because this artifact specifies the segments for a Family of Systems (\FoS), there are some specifications that include references to variants within the \FoS.
This allows for a single \SSS to be created that covers all variants of the family.
While this approach consolidates documentation, care must be taken to ensure comprehension of applicable specifications for each variant, as also must be done for statement of Threshold and Objective qualifiers.
